Zork is a text-adventure game. I have created my own interpretation of it by creating a unique gameplay narrative that is a spin on Princess and Knight stories.
The game runs on user inputs as prompted by the system and includes short quizzes and riddles that allow the user to take control and charge of the game-play alongside their control of the characters. 
The game is story-based, but allows for differentiation, where every time the user plays, depending on the choices the user makes, a different story takes place.
Instructions on how to play are given in the game, where user options are explicitly displayed, and hints are available upon request. 
The game is aimed at a younger audience due to the depth of the story-telling but also due to the lack of action seen in other existing systems aimed towards older kids.
